# React Book Library
React Book Library is my final project for project defence with React.js course at Softuni.
This project is an online book library where you can see different books, add comments to them and add books.

# üìê Technical description
The app have to ways to be used. The first is like a guest without login, where you can only see the homepage with some listed books and information and the second is when you login. Then you can use all the functionality of the website. Logged-in users can add books and comments. They can also delete and update the books they added. If the book is added from somebody else it can only be seen and not modified.

# üé® Front-end
The html template is taken from http://www.templatemo.com/preview/templatemo_086_book_store and it is managed by react. In audition to be complete i added some more pages and css styles.

# üìã Used technologies
